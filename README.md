## What is music.songsforsplings.com?

Most artists have relatively simple discographies. However, when content comes in several languages, in several albums, available through several channels, and distributes it through many partners, it becomes difficult for audiences from all over the world to find the content they are looking for. To solve this problem, Songs for Saplings now offers an iframe-embeddable, cloud-hosted web app for navigating their discography.

The stack has a React/NextJS frontend deployed to DigitalOcean Droplet. To allow non-technical people to manage the discography efficiently, an integrated Google sheet defines the content that the app will display. Opt-in cookies, Mixpanel integration, and automated mailing integrate the app with the rest of the Songs for Saplings ecosystem.

With music.songsforspalings.com, listeners can access the content they want quickly and easily. Songs for Saplings can distribute the content they want to new listeners more easily.Finally, Songs for Saplings can now manage their discography and other content all from one place.

This webapp is primarily intended as an iframe-embeddable widget to be easily added to people's sites. However, it is also a standalone site: [music.songsforsaplings.com](https://music.songsforsaplings.com).
